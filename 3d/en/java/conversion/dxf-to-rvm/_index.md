 In order to render DXF to RVM, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-3d) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java programmers can easily convert DXF file to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DXF file via the constructor of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Set RVM specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with RVM file extension & object of RvmSaveOptions

 Before running the Java conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.3D for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="DXF to RVM Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the DXF in an object of Scene 
Scene document = new Scene("template.dxf");
// create an instance of RvmSaveOptions 
RvmSaveOptions options = new RvmSaveOptions();
// save DXF as a RVM 
document.save("output.rvm", options);

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
